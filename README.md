The flipbook is hosted on GitHub Pages, making use of simple HTML to present a sequence of images that were originally pages in a PDF document. While this version does not feature animated page turns, it offers a clear and straightforward way to view each page at your own pace.

## How It's Made

The content you are about to see was created by converting a PDF document into individual images, each representing a page from the document. These images were then compiled into an HTML file, allowing for easy viewing through any web browser. This method provides a simple yet effective way to digitize and share content, making it more accessible and engaging for viewers.
